# NONGAAP-DEMO
This is a project utilize both web scarping and python data processing with a deep understanding of 10k filings in SEC. It's intention is to find the correct reconciliation chart of earning release, and scrap all the corresponding accounts used for adjusted ebitda(Non-GAAP financial measures) in the chart, with amount that is most up to date.

The other part is to find (if any) definition, justification and caveat used for such Non-GAAP financial measurements)

The process has been absolutly amazing, and this can never be done without all the support, teaching and guidance from the best professor I have ever worked with, professor Darren Henderson from Laurier:https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/lazaridis-school-of-business-and-economics/faculty-profiles/darren-henderson/index.html

Meanwhile, I am also extremly thankful to professor James Moore :https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/lazaridis-school-of-business-and-economics/faculty-profiles/james-moore/index.html
